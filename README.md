## Computer Vision Project

Using Tensorflow and Python, some trained machine learning models are scripted here. Some of the techniques used are defining the model (either Keras or TF), creating a DataSource, some event-driven hooks for each training epoch, and data processing. I can't remember if I did finetuning for this one, but my preferred way of doing it is to freeze layers and preprocess the dataset according to the input head.
